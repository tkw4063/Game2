# Game2

* Type: Role-playing
* Overview of the game: The plot of my game will be centered around an astronaut landing on Mars to explore and discovering that instead of Mars being uninhabited, like we all think, it has dinosaurs on it. The dinosaurs have made a cult on mars. The astronaut then has to gain the trust of the dinosaurs, she does this by providing them with soda. She must gain the trust of all the dinosaurs, becoming their cult leader, before they can kill her. 
* Description of your gimmick: There will be thought bubbles that appear over the dinosaurs heads to reflect their trust level of the astronaut. These thoughts will show the progression of the astronaut becoming the cult leader.
